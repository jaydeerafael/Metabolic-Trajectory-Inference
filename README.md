# Metabolic-Trajectory-Inference
This Project was funded by the Student Innovation Fund by RANN√çS.

In this repository is a jupyter notebook and a pipeline that was generated to conduct the project.

Jupyter Notebook:
This notebook contains the approach to simulate an oxygen decreasing environment for E.coli. The figures show that in the metabolic flux level, there is a trajectory as to where the metabolic state transition occurs.


Pipeline:
This pipeline was generated in MATLAB to take the sc-RNA seq data and generated thousands of genome-scale metabolic models out of it. In there, I used the rFASTCORMICS to generate the models.
